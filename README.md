# KomenosV1
Komenos V1 is simple TicTacToe game between two players written in Brainfuck

It was written near date which ASM2BF was written. Too bad, I have lost original source code.

My next attempt will be, decipher this and add very simple MINMAX AI.

It features full win checking. Estimate amount of 500 cells are needed to run this application. Brainfuck interpreter should be decently fast. Any fancy features are not used here.

Size: 72KB. I could go lower, but is there any reason I should?
Win checking mechanism takes ~60% of source code.
